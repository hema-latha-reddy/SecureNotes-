# Secure Notes

Secure Notes is a web application that allows users to securely store and manage their notes. The project is built using the MERN stack and employs the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm for encrypting and decrypting notes, ensuring data security and privacy.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality.
- **Note Encryption**: Notes are encrypted using the AES algorithm for maximum security.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their notes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices.
- **MERN Stack**: Combines MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js for a seamless experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
  - React Router
  - Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Encryption**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure data handling

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- MongoDB running locally or a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-notes.git
   cd secure-notes
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ..

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Start backend server
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Start frontend development server
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
